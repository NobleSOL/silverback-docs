# Staking & Rewards

Stake $BACK to earn your share of protocol revenue.

---

## How Staking Works

1. **Stake $BACK** → Lock tokens in the staking contract
2. **Earn Rewards** → Receive share of buyback distributions
3. **Claim or Compound** → Take rewards or add to stake
4. **Unstake Anytime** → Withdraw your tokens when ready

## Reward Mechanism

### Where Rewards Come From

Unlike inflationary staking (minting new tokens), Silverback rewards come from **real revenue**:

```
Protocol Revenue
      ↓
  Buybacks ($BACK purchased from market)
      ↓
  Staking Pool (bought tokens deposited)
      ↓
  Distributed to Stakers
```

This means:
- Rewards are backed by actual profits
- No token supply inflation
- Sustainable long-term yield

### Reward Distribution

Rewards are distributed proportionally based on:
- Your staked amount
- Total amount staked by all users
- Revenue generated in the period

**Example:**
- Total staked: 1,000,000 $BACK
- Your stake: 10,000 $BACK (1%)
- Period rewards: 5,000 $BACK
- Your rewards: 50 $BACK (1%)

## Staking Benefits

| Benefit | Description |

## APR Factors

Your actual APR depends on:

1. **Protocol Revenue** — More trading volume & profits = higher rewards
2. **Total Staked** — More stakers = rewards split more ways
3. **Token Price** — Affects buyback quantities

APR will vary based on these factors. Higher protocol usage generally means better staking returns.

## Staking vs. Holding

| Factor | Just Holding | Staking |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| Earn Rewards | ❌ | ✅ |
| Governance | Limited | Full weight |
| Flexibility | Instant transfers | Must unstake first |
