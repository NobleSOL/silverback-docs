## Token Details

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Token Name | Silverback |
| Ticker | $BACK |
| Launch Platform | Virtuals Protocol |
| Model | Unicorn Tokenomics |
| Network | Base |

## Launch via Virtuals Protocol

$BACK launches through Virtuals Protocol's **Unicorn** tokenomics model, which provides:

- Fair launch mechanics
- Built-in liquidity
- Transparent distribution
- AI agent integration

## Supply Mechanics

### No Inflationary Rewards

Unlike many DeFi tokens, $BACK does not mint new tokens for rewards. Instead:

1. Protocol generates revenue (fees, trading profits)
2. Revenue is used to **buy back** $BACK from the market
3. Bought tokens fill the **staking reward pool**
4. Stakers earn from this pool

This creates:
- **Sustainable yield** — Rewards backed by real revenue
- **Buy pressure** — Continuous market purchases
- **No dilution** — Supply doesn't increase

---

## Revenue Sources

The protocol generates revenue from multiple sources:

| Source | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| DEX Swap Fees | Portion of 0.3% fees from all swaps |
| Anchor Pool Fees | Revenue from Keeta anchor operations |
| Treasury Trading | Profits from AI agent's systematic trading |
| Cross-Chain Arbitrage | Returns from multi-network opportunities |

All revenue streams contribute to the buyback mechanism.

## Economic Flywheel

```
Revenue Generated
       ↓
   Buybacks
       ↓
 Staking Rewards
       ↓
  More Staking
       ↓
 Reduced Selling
       ↓
 Price Support
       ↓
More Users/Volume
       ↓
More Revenue...
```

The model creates a self-reinforcing cycle where protocol success benefits token holders.

## Why This Model?

### Problem with Inflationary Rewards

Many DeFi protocols:
- Mint tokens for rewards → Dilutes holders
- Creates constant sell pressure
- Unsustainable long-term
- "Farm and dump" culture

### Silverback's Approach

- Rewards come from **real revenue**
- Buybacks create **buy pressure**
- No new supply = **no dilution**
- Sustainable for long-term holders
