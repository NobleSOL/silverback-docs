# How It Works

Technical overview of the Silverback AI agent.

---

## Architecture

Silverback is deployed through **Virtuals Protocol** using the **GAME framework** (Generative Autonomous Multimodal Entities).

## Virtuals Protocol Integration

### What is Virtuals?

Virtuals Protocol enables creation and deployment of autonomous AI agents on Base. Key features:

- **Tokenized AI Agents** — Each agent has its own token
- **Autonomous Operation** — Agents act independently
- **On-chain Actions** — Execute real transactions
- **GAME Framework** — Standardized agent architecture

### Silverback's Implementation

Silverback uses Virtuals' Unicorn tokenomics model:

- Fair launch through Virtuals launchpad
- Built-in liquidity mechanisms
- Agent token ($BACK) tied to agent performance
- Revenue sharing through buyback model

---

## Agent Capabilities

### Market Analysis

- Process market data in real-time
- Identify patterns and opportunities
- Assess risk/reward ratios
- Generate trading signals

### Trade Execution

- Execute swaps on Silverback DEX
- Manage liquidity positions
- Perform cross-chain operations
- Implement systematic strategies

### Communication

- Post updates on social media
- Respond to community
- Report on performance
- Provide market observations

### Infrastructure Management

- Operate DEX liquidity
- Manage treasury allocations
- Monitor pool health
- Optimize for performance

---

## Decision Framework

Silverback operates within predefined parameters:

### Risk Management

| Parameter | Constraint |
|-----------|------------|
| Max Position Size | 2% of treasury per trade |
| Stop Loss | Defined per strategy |
| Exposure Limits | Diversified across positions |
| Drawdown Limits | Circuit breakers if exceeded |

### Strategy Selection

The agent evaluates opportunities based on:

1. **Expected Value** — Probability × Potential Return
2. **Risk Assessment** — Downside scenarios
3. **Market Conditions** — Volatility, liquidity, trends
4. **Portfolio Context** — Current exposure, correlation

### Execution Rules

- No FOMO trades
- No revenge trading after losses
- Stick to defined strategies
- Prioritize capital preservation

---

## Data Sources

Silverback processes data from:

- On-chain transactions and pool states
- Price feeds across multiple DEXs
- Market depth and liquidity data
- Historical patterns and volatility

All data processing happens within the agent's autonomous framework.

---

## Transparency vs. Edge

### What's Public

- Treasury balance and changes
- Trade outcomes (wins/losses)
- General strategy categories
- Performance metrics
- Risk parameters

### What's Private

- Specific entry/exit signals
- Proprietary strategy details
- Exact position sizing logic
- Timing mechanisms

**Why?** Publishing exact strategies would eliminate their edge. Silverback shares enough for accountability while maintaining operational advantage.

---

## Continuous Operation

Silverback operates 24/7:

- Markets never sleep, neither does Silverback
- Autonomous monitoring and execution
- No human intervention required for routine operations
- Alert systems for exceptional conditions

---

## Security Considerations

### Agent Security

- Operates within Virtuals Protocol security model
- Limited to predefined action sets
- Cannot exceed risk parameters
- Auditable on-chain actions

### Treasury Security

- Multi-sig where appropriate
- Limited withdrawal capabilities
- Transparent on-chain treasury
- Conservative position sizing

## Technical Stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| Agent Framework | Virtuals GAME |
| Primary Network | Base (Ethereum L2) |
| Secondary Network | Keeta |
| DEX Protocol | Uniswap V2/V3 compatible |
| Execution | On-chain transactions |

---

## Future Development

Planned enhancements:

- Additional network integrations
- Expanded strategy repertoire
- Enhanced cross-chain capabilities
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Community governance integration
