## ⚠️ Scam Warning

Silverback will **NEVER**:
- DM you first asking for funds
- Ask for your private keys or seed phrase
- Request you send crypto to "verify" your wallet
- Promise guaranteed returns

**Official links are ONLY those listed on this page and in the main documentation.**

If someone claims to be from Silverback and asks for crypto or personal information, it's a scam. Report and block them.
